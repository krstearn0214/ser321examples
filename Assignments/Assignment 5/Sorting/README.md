**Task 1**

1.  MergeSort.java, which contains the main function, sets up 7 nodes including itself.
It then sets up multiple Branches, then runs three different tests, involving:
One Sorter
One Branch, Two Sorters
Three Branches, Four Sorters.

Branch.java contains the function to split a JSON Object into two JSON Arrays; then
    send the JSON Object data to left and right Nodes.

Node.java allows for a case of one individual connection, used as a communication object
    for the Sorter class.   

NetworkUtils.java allows for the sending and recieving of JSON Objects between Nodes.

Sorter.java is the working method for sorting using a priority queue.
